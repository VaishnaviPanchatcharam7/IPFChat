## Custom knowledge chatbot
A custom knowledge chatbot is a specialised artificial intelligence program designed to interact with users and provide accurate and tailored information based on a specific domain or topic.
Unlike generic chatbots, custom knowledge chatbot is trained on a specific dataset which allows it to answer queries with higher precision and expertise in that particular area.
#### There are 3 main steps in developing a custom knowledge chatbot:

1) Data collection
2) Data processing
3) Inference
